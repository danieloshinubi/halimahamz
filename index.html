I don't know what type of sin God cannot forgive, his mercy is endless,i just want to make it known that we serve an awsome God. I think i am actually getting there.<p> school is a place of mass knowlege and information,God is ever-present in our lives. I think i am mentally and physically prepared to be in God's presence again. i pray God helps.Well,i know he will.<p>Hi everybody i am Halima and i love to read and be in solitude, it keeps temptations out of my sight and reduces the level at which i commit major sins,i am not a very friendly person. coding is tough,if you make just one mistake then all what you coded is wrong.</p></div>
